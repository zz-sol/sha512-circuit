/// Full execution witness for one SHA-512 block compression.
///
/// `BlockTrace` captures every intermediate value produced during the compression of a
/// single 128-byte message block.  It is produced by [`crate::sha512::Sha512Circuit::compress_block`]
/// and consumed by [`crate::sha512::Sha512Circuit::build_plonky3_air_trace`] to populate
/// the AIR witness matrix.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// 1. The prover calls `compress_block` to obtain a `BlockTrace`.
/// 2. The `BlockTrace` is passed to `build_plonky3_air_trace`, which lays out all witness
///    columns (working state words, limb decompositions, carry bits, etc.).
/// 3. The resulting [`p3_matrix::dense::RowMajorMatrix`] is handed to the Plonky3 prover.
///
/// ## Verification without a STARK
///
/// [`crate::sha512::Sha512Circuit::verify_block_trace`] checks the trace algebraically
/// (without a zero-knowledge proof) and is mainly useful for testing and debugging.
